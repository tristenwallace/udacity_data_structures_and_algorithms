# Analysis

## Task 0:
**Time Complexity:** O(1)

This algorithm is constant time because it has a running time independent of the input size

## Task 1:
**Time Complexity:** O(n)

This algorithm runs in  linear time. It has two seperate loops, each one iterating from 1 to n, which results in O(2n). Since coefficients in Big-O are negligible with large input sizes, runtime simplifies to O(n).

## Task 2:
**Time Complexity:** O(n)

This algorithm runs in  linear time. It has two seperate loops, each one iterating from 1 to n, which results in O(2n). Since coefficients in Big-O are negligible with large input sizes, runtime simplifies to O(n).

## Task 3:
**Time Complexity:** O(nlog(n))

This algorithm is superlinear  because even though it has two separate for-loops that result in O(2n); it also has a sorting function which is 0(nlogn). It simplifies to 0(nlogn) because that is the highest order term.
   
## Task 4:
**Time Complexity:** O(nlog(n))

This algorithm is superlinear  because even though it has two separate for-loops that result in O(2n); it also has a sorting function which is 0(nlogn). It simplifies to 0(nlogn) because that is the highest order term.
