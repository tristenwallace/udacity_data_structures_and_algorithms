### You have been given an array of length = n. The array contains integers
# from 0 to n - 2. Each number in the array is present exactly once except 
# for one number which is present twice. Find and return this duplicate 
# number present in the array.

'''
Notice carefully that
1. All the elements of the array are always non-negative
2. If array length = n, then elements would start from 0 to (n-2), i.e. Natural numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5...(n-2)
3. There is only SINGLE element which is present twice.

Therefore let's find the sum of all elements (current_sum) of the original array, and
find the sum of first (n-2) Natural numbers (expected_sum).

Trick: 
The second occurance of a particular number (say `x`) is actually occupying the space 
that would have been utilized by the number (n-1). This leads to: 
current_sum  = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + .... + (n-2) + x
expected_sum = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + .... + (n-2)
current_sum - expected_sum = x 
Tada!!! :)

def duplicate_number(arr):

    # Traverse the original array in the forward direction 
    for num in arr:
        current_sum += num
    
    
    # Traverse from 0 to (length of array-1) to get the expected_sum
    # Alternatively, you can use the formula for sum of an Arithmetic Progression to get the expected_sum
    
    # The argument of range() functions are:
    # starting index [OPTIONAL], ending index (non exclusive), and the increment/decrement size [OPTIONAL]
    # It means that if the array length = n, loop will run form 0 to (n-2)
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        expected_sum += i
