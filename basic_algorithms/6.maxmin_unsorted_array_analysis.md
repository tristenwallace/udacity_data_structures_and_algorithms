## Efficiency:
**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of integers in the list. This is because we go through the list only once, and each comparison and assignment operation within the loop is O(1). It could have been acomplished by sorting first, but that would have been at best O(nlog(n)) or O(nk)
**Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the min_val and max_val variables, regardless of the input size.

## Code Design

Instead of sorting and recording the first and last index, we iteratively update min and max to achieve our answer in a single pass.
