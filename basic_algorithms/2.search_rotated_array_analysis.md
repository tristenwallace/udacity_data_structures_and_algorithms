## Efficiency:
The modified binary search algorithm maintains an O(log n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the input array. This efficiency is achieved by halving the search space with each iteration of the while loop, similar to a standard binary search. However, additional checks are performed to determine the sorted portion of the array, which slightly increases the constant factor in the time complexity but does not affect the logarithmic nature of the algorithm. The space complexity is O(1), since the algorithm operates in place, using only a few variables for indices and comparisons, regardless of the input array's size.

## Code Design:
The code design separates the concerns of finding the pivot point where the array is rotated and performing a binary search. The function checks whether the left or right half of the array is sorted and then decides in which half to continue the search based on whether the target number falls within the sorted range. This approach leverages the sorted nature of the array segments to guide the search process efficiently.
