## Efficiency
### Time Complexity:

**Sorting:** The implementation of merge sort contributes most significantly to the time complexity, with O(nlog(n)), where n is the number of elements in the input array. Merge sort achieves this by recursively dividing the array into halves and merging them in sorted order.
**Number Construction:** After sorting, the array is traversed once to construct the two numbers by alternately appending digits. This step has a linear time complexity, O(n).
Combining these, the overall time complexity remains dominated by the merge sort, O(nlog(n)).

### Space Complexity:

**Sorting:** Merge sort has a space complexity of O(n) due to the additional arrays used for merging. In each merge step, a temporary array is needed to store the sorted sequence before copying it back to the original array segment.
**Number Construction:** The additional space required for constructing the two numbers and the output array is O(1), as it only involves a fixed number of integer variables.
Overall, the space complexity of the solution is O(n), primarily due to the merge sort process.

## Code Design
### Merge Sort:

The solution employs merge sort for its reliable performance and compatibility with the O(nlog(n)) time complexity requirement. The choice of merge sort over other algorithms like quicksort (which also offers O(nlog(n)) average time complexity) is due to merge sort's guaranteed performance regardless of the input array's initial ordering.

### Descending Order:

The merge sort is tailored to sort the array in descending order. This ensures that when constructing the two numbers, the larger digits are placed in more significant positions, thereby maximizing the sum of the resulting numbers.

### Digit Alternation for Number Construction:

After sorting, digits are alternated between the two numbers in a way that balances their lengths. This technique not only ensures that the sum is maximized but also adheres to the constraint that the numbers' digit counts cannot differ by more than 1.
