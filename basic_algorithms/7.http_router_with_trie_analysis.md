## Efficiency
### Time Complexity:

**Inserting a Route:** O(k), where k is the number of parts in the route path. Insertion involves traversing or creating a new node for each part of the path, which is a linear operation relative to the path's length.

**Lookup:** O(k), similar to insertion, where k is the number of parts in the lookup path. The time complexity arises from traversing the trie from the root to the node corresponding to the last part of the path.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(n*k), where n is the number of routes and k is the average length of a route path. Each node in the trie represents a part of one or more route paths, and the space used grows with the number of unique path parts across all routes.

## Code Design

**Trie Over Other Data Structures:** The trie is chosen for its ability to quickly insert and find routes based on hierarchical path parts, making it ideal for HTTP routing.

**Handler at Leaf Nodes:** Handlers are stored at leaf nodes corresponding to complete paths, ensuring that each route is mapped to a unique handler.

**Splitting Paths by '/':** This approach aligns with the hierarchical nature of URLs, allowing efficient traversal of the trie based on the URL structure.
