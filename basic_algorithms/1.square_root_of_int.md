# 1.square_root_of_int

## Efficiency
The sqrt function implements a binary search algorithm to find the floored square root of an integer, which is highly efficient for this problem. The time complexity is O(log n) because the search space is halved with each iteration of the while loop, where n is the value of the input number. This logarithmic time complexity is characteristic of binary search algorithms and is significantly faster than a linear search approach, especially for large numbers. The space complexity is O(1), as the function uses only a few variables (start, end, mid, mid_squared) that occupy constant space, regardless of the input size.


## Code Design
The code design is straightforward and follows a logical progression typical of binary search algorithms. It handles edge cases first (numbers less than 2) and then proceeds with the binary search between 1 and number // 2, leveraging the mathematical property that the square root of a number is always less than or equal to half the number for numbers greater than 4. The choice of number // 2 as the upper bound of the search space optimizes the algorithm by reducing unnecessary checks.
