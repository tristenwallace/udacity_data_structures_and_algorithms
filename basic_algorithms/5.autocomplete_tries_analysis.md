## Efficiency:
### Time Complexity:

**Insertion (insert):** O(m) for each word, where m is the length of the word. This is because we traverse the trie for each character in the word, inserting nodes as necessary.
**Finding Prefix (find):** O(p), where p is the length of the prefix. We only need to traverse the trie down to the node representing the last character of the prefix.
**Finding Suffixes (suffixes):** O(s), where s is the total number of characters in all suffixes for a given prefix node. This involves a depth-first search from the prefix node to all its descendants.

### Space Complexity:

Trie Storage: O(n * m), where n is the number of words, and m is the average length of the words. Each node potentially holds a character, and the trie's overall size depends on the number of unique character sequences (i.e., prefixes) across all words.

## Code Design:
For the suffix finding functionality within the Trie structure, the design is centered around a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach, encapsulated within the suffixes method of the Trie class. This method leverages the hierarchical nature of the trie to efficiently enumerate all suffixes branching out from a given node (corresponding to a prefix). The use of recursion in _suffixes_recur, a nested helper function within suffixes, allows for a clean and intuitive traversal of the trie's nodes. This approach naturally follows the trie's tree-like structure, visiting all child nodes and accumulating the characters into suffixes.
